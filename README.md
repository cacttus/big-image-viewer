# Big Image Viewer

This simple image viewing application can open PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF images that are the maximum size of your graphics card's OpenGL texture size (8192+).  It can open images that many applications may crash when attempting to open, and it opens them fairly quickly.  You can zoom, pan, and rotate the image using the mouse.
